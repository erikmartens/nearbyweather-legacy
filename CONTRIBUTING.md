## Contribution Guidelines

#### Before You Begin Coding

1. Select an issue-ticket that is labeled `Contributable` from the next release project as detailed in the [README.md](README.md/#app-releases). Issues from future releases are not open for submission.

```
❗️ There are many reasons for issue-tickets not being labeled with `Contributable`. 
❗️ The most important may be that they require other tickets to be completed first 
❗️ as they will interfere with same code. Therefore you may do unnecessary work
❗️ which might not be usable when tackeling them anyway.
```

2. Comment that you want to start working on the issue
3. Wait for feedback to receive clearance for beginning the coding process
    - You may be asked to join the official [discord](https://discord.gg/fxPgKzC) to receive further instructions
    - For some tickets you will be asked to deliver a design document that needs to be cleared before you can begin your work
4. If you need help or guidance there will be a channel dedicated to your issue-ticket on the official [discord](https://discord.gg/fxPgKzC)

```
❗️ If you submit code without following these steps you may or may not receive a review.
❗️ However in the case of receiving a review it may be subject to an adverse amount of 
❗️ change requests.
```

#### Writing and Delivering Your Code

1. Before you start please make sure you meet the [contribution requirements](#contribution-requirements)
2. Checkout the `develop`-branch from your local clone and create a new branch from there (the name to use will be outlined in the issue-ticket)
3. Open a pull request as soon as you commit your first changes
4. Set the pull request to draft while you are working on it
5. Make sure your code runs locally before you request a review
6. Make sure to not commit any changes relating to CocoaPods within the project file (you can run `pod deintegrate` before your final commit)
7. Make sure you do not introduce any new SwiftLint warnings into your code
8. Once your are ready to have your code looked at, set it to ready for review

```
❗️ Do not include any changes that are not related to your assigned issue ticket.
❗️ Your pull request will not be reviewed until this requirement is met.
