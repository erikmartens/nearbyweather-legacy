## About the App

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è By using the app you automatically agree to the [privacy policy](PRIVACYPOLICY.md) and the [terms of use](TERMSOFUSE.md).

NearbyWeather is a simple weather app, that provides current weather information for nearby cities, as well for bookmarked locations. NearbyWeather uses the OpenWeatherMap API to download weather data. Additionally the OpenWeatherMaps location database is directly bootstrapped into the app for quick access.

With NearbyWeather you can:

- See current weather information for bookmarked and nearby places via a list and a map view
- See the current temperature on your app icon
- Detailed weather information is offered in addition to the overviews
- Add places as bookmarks via OpenWeatherMaps weather-station data base
- Choose your preferred units (celsius/fahrenheit/kelvin & kilometres/miles)
- Access previously loaded data offline

```
‚ùóÔ∏èPlease note that you need to supply your own OpenWeatherMap API key, in order to use the app.
```
