> ‚ùóÔ∏è By using the app you automatically agree to the [privacy policy](PRIVACYPOLICY.md) and the [terms of use](TERMSOFUSE.md).

> ‚ùóÔ∏èPlease note that you need to supply your own OpenWeatherMap API key, in order to use the app.

NearbyWeather is a simple weather app, that provides current weather information for nearby weather stations, as well for bookmarked weather stations. NearbyWeather uses the OpenWeatherMap API to download weather data. Additionally the OpenWeatherMap's station-database is directly bootstrapped into the app for quick access.
